I am a MSc student at McGill University and Mila under the supervision of Prof. Prakash Panangaden.
 
Interested in the theoretical underpinnings of machine learning, my research interests are sequential data, RNNs, and automata theory. I have also dabbled in normalizing flows and reinforcement learning.

As a native Montrealer, I am thrilled to participate in the growing local AI ecosystem.
